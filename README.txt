Hacking Notes
=============

My hacking notes.

I have a TON of old notes in a private repo that I want to port over to text format.
The old notes are from the 100+ systems on Hack The Box I hacked.
Markdown is cool, but I like just having the raw data, so will convert to text...

PS - Current focus is on web exploitation.
Reviewing PortSwigger modules and taking comprehensive notes.
