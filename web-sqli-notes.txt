- Avoid semicolons, they cause problems.
- Hash comment doesn't work in my experience for MySQL.
- If having issues with --, use -- - instead to prevent the first symbol from
  being trimmed.
- Sometimes you have to mess with the comment.
  E.g., In some cases union select null -- may work
        Else, try union select null -- -
        Else, try union select null--
        etc.
        (Just depends on the code)
